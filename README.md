# Python socket pygame in development

## Current Known Issues

- Daemon thread error on system exit when having input() on a thread
- Sometimes max connections occur for no reason (possibly restarting client too quickly)
- ~~Client unable to send message after closing then connecting back to socket~~
- ~~Max connections funcionality not working as intended~~
